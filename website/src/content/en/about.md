I capture **presence** — in music, movement, and nature.

From **Goa’s Chek Garden** to **Kastrы Fest**, I film **neo-ethnic performances**, **somatic rituals**, and **digital detox moments**.

My camera **amplifies** the moment. Every frame is a portal.

Currently exploring **art residencies** and **slow cinema**.

Let’s co-create.
