## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER: Media Download System

### The Problem
The installed Instagram DM MCP server **cannot download media from posts**. It's designed only for:
- Sending DMs
- Getting profile info
- Browsing chats
- **NOT downloading post media**

### What We Tried
1. ✅ Instagram session authentication - **WORKING**
2. ✅ Profile browsing - **WORKING** 
3. ❌ Media download from posts - **FAILED**
4. ✅ Website structure - **READY**

### Test Case That Failed
- **URL**: https://www.instagram.com/p/DNEmgXyIJE7/?img_index=1
- **Expected**: Download the post media
- **Result**: MCP server has no tool for downloading post media
- **Error**: No appropriate MCP tool available

## 📁 What We Have

### ✅ Working Components
- Instagram session authentication
- Profile information access
- Website HTML/CSS framework
- Instagram embed system
- Project folder structure

### ❌ Missing Components
- **Media download capability**
- **Content collection system**
- **Real Instagram data integration**

## 🎯 Immediate Action Required

### Option 1: New MCP Server
- Install a different MCP server that can download Instagram media
- Test with the specific post URL
- Verify download functionality

### Option 2: Alternative Approach
- Use Instagram oEmbed API for live content
- Manual content collection
- Different technical solution

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use current MCP for metadata
- Use different tool for media download
- Combine approaches

## 📊 Project Readiness
